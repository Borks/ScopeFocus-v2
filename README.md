# Scopefocus Extension for Visual Studio code

A Visual Studio Code extension for focusing on specific parts in code.
Color themes are supposed to help but in my opinion in long files they just make a big rainbow.

`ctrl+alt+d` - Add focus to selection

`ctrl+alt+f` - Disbale focus

`ctrl+alt+x` - Remove focus from location under text cursor
