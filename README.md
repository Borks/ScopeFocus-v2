# Scopefocus Extension for Visual Studio code

A Visual Studio Code extension for focusing on specific parts in code.
Color themes are supposed to help but in my opinion in long files they just make a big rainbow.

## Features

`alt+d` - Focus on selection

`alt+d alt+d` - Focus on selection and round up to full lines

`alt+f` - Toggle focus

`alt+x` - Remove focus from selection or from under cursor

`alt+backspace` - Remove focus from all places

## Settings

`scopefocus.opacity` - Visibility of out of focus areas.

`scopefocus.padding` -  How many lines should be focused extra when following cursor

`scopefocus.focusType` - Soft, hard, padding mode.

`scopefocus.roundLines` - _Not yet implemented_ If focusing should by default round up to full lines
